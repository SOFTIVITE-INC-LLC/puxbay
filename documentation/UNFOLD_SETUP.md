# Django Unfold Admin Theme Setup

## Installation

Since you're running the server with `python3 manage.py runserver`, you likely have a virtual environment. Follow these steps:

### 1. Stop the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

### 2. Install Django Unfold

If you're using a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first, then:
pip install django-unfold
```

If you're not using a virtual environment:
```bash
# Install for your user
python3 -m pip install --user django-unfold
```

### 3. Update Settings

The settings have already been updated in `possystem/settings.py`. See the changes below.

### 4. Collect Static Files

After installation, run:
```bash
python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### 5. Restart the Server

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### 6. Access the Admin

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and enjoy the new modern interface!
